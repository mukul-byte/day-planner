# day-planner

Day Planner, where you can add/cut the tasks.
This project involves the use of:
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  JavaScript
*  Node
*  Express
*  EJS Templating

One can make a list of all the task he needs to do. And can check them to cut when the task completes.  
I also provided a work route for extending the idea ou using templates and exports object.  
While making this project, I learnt a lot og different concepts of Express, Templating, exports and functions. And also, putting this on github add a cherry on the cake of learning.
